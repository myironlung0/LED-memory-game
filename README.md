# LED-memory-game
Simple Arduino memory game where players repeat increasingly complex LED sequences. Each round extends the sequence by one random element.
The game ends when the player makes a mistake, signaled by a buzzer sound.

My project uses:
- Arduino Uno,
- 4 LEDs (connected to pins 2, 4, 6, 8),
- 4 push buttons (connected to pins 3, 5, 7, 9),
- Buzzer (connected to pin 11),
- Resistors and connecting wires.
